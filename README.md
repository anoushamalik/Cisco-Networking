# Networking Simulation Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Cisco Packet Tracer simulation files that cover various networking concepts and techniques. These files are designed to help students and networking professionals practice and understand key networking topics such as subnet masking, internet cloud configuration, VLAN trunking, static and dynamic routing, file transfers, and more.

## Contents

### 1. **Subnet Masking**
   - **Description**: This simulation demonstrates how to design and implement subnetting in a network. It includes examples of calculating subnet masks, dividing IP address spaces, and configuring routers and switches to handle multiple subnets.

### 2. **Internet Cloud Configuration**
   - **Description**: This file showcases the configuration of an internet cloud within a network simulation. It includes the setup of WAN connections, simulating internet access, and the use of NAT (Network Address Translation) for addressing.

### 3. **VLAN Trunking**
   - **Description**: This project demonstrates the setup of VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and VLAN trunking between switches. It includes configuring VLAN IDs, assigning ports to VLANs, and enabling trunk links between switches.

### 4. **Static Routing**
   - **Description**: This simulation provides an example of static routing within a network. It covers the configuration of static routes on routers to ensure connectivity between different subnets and networks.

### 5. **Dynamic Routing**
   - **Description**: This project illustrates the implementation of dynamic routing protocols, such as OSPF or EIGRP, in a network. The file includes the configuration of routers to automatically discover routes and adapt to changes in the network.

### 6. **File Transfers**
   - **Description**: This simulation shows the process of transferring files across a network using protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol). It includes setting up servers and clients, and performing file uploads and downloads.
